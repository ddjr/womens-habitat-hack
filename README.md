# womens-habitat-hack!
Many of the challenges involved micro-tasks that were not pure code. 
Work done:  

-We have created a mockup of a new and enhanced website with the donate button being more prominent on mobile  
-Helped Lina use their existing platform, Raiser's Edge, in order to generate emails for donors rather than a homebrew solution  
-Created a marketing campaign template  
-Enhanced the leave button on the website to support key-press and remove back button  
-Twilio code to allow callers to call anonymously so the abuser cannot see the phone log going to the shelter
