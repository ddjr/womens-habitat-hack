Capital One Canada, with the support of Hackworks, will kick off its Gift the Code Hackathon on Friday, October 21, 2016 to Sunday, October 23, 2016. In just 40 hours, over 100 participants passionate about problem solving will brainstorm, build and submit technology solutions to address specific digital challenges faced by six Toronto-based charities. 

Driven by the desire to commit as much funding as possible toward their respective causes, local charity organizations often operate on tight budgets which can prevent them from taking full advantage of digital solutions and top-tier technology talent that could help advance their mission even more. The Capital One Canada Gift the Code Hackathon aspires to change this and give participating organizations a much-needed boost.

# Goals:
Build tech that was dead easy to implyment.
Womens Habitat don't not have a tech team. Any thing we build should be easy for them to use.

# Projects


Many of the challenges involved micro-tasks that were not pure code. 
Work done:  

-We have created a mockup of a new and enhanced website with the donate button being more prominent on mobile  
-Helped Lina use their existing platform, Raiser's Edge, in order to generate emails for donors rather than a homebrew solution  
-Created a marketing campaign template  
-Enhanced the leave button on the website to support key-press and remove back button  
-Twilio code to allow callers to call anonymously so the abuser cannot see the phone log going to the shelter
